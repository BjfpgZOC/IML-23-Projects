## Task 3
Project 3 was a task based on applying deep learning techniques to make decisions on food taste similarity based on images and human judgements. The goal of the project was to accurately determine the food taste similarity in sets of triplets (A,B,C). The dataset consisted of 10000 images. The first step in the modelling process was to preprocess the provided data by generating embeddings for the images using a pretrained image classification model from Pytorch library. In this project, both ResNet50 and WideResnet101 models were investigated. Subsequently, these embeddings were used to generate the training and testing dataset from the triplet sets provided. The stacked embeddings along with binary target outputs were then passed through a defined model that consisted of linear layers, batch normalization layers, dropouts and activation functions(ReLU and Sigmoid). Using the ResNet50 Model, on the public dataset in the evaluation server, the proposed model achieved a prediction accuracy of approximately 0.6886, while using the WideResnet101 Model, the proposed model achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.6867.
