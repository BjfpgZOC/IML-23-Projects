## Task 4
Project 4 was a task based on applying transfer learning to identify promising materials for organic solar cells. The goal of the project was to predict the HOMO-LUMO gap of a given molecule. A pretrained dataset of 50000 samples and 1000 features and target labels (LUMO energy) was provided. The training data consisted of 1000 samples (with 1000 features each) and target labels : HOMO-LUMO gap pairs were provided. The first step in the modelling process involved training a network with the pretrained dataset to accurately predict the LUMO energies. The next step involved, passing the 1000 features in the training dataset through the network trained on the pretrained dataset, and lower dimensional features were extracted which was then later used to train a regression model using ElasticNet from the sklearn library to predict the HOMO-LUMO gaps. The proposed model achieved a RMSE of 0.2135 on the public dataset in the evaluation server.
