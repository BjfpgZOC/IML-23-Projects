## Task 2
Project 2 was a task based on applying machine learning approaches to real life scenarios. The goal of the project was to predict electricity prices in Switzerland given the electricity prices of other countries. The training dataset consisted of 900 samples, and each sample had prices of 10 countries including Switzerland and an additional label that denotes the season. The testing dataset consisted of 100 samples. The first step in the modelling process was to preprocess the provided data by encoding the seasonal information (4 seasons) such that the dataset can be directly utilized for training purposes which was done using the OneHotEncoder function from the sklearn library. Subsequently, the KNN imputer function was utilized to fill up the missing (NaN) data in the training and testing datasets. For the purpose of training a model to predict the electricity prices, a squared exponential (RBF) kernel in combination with the GridSearchCV algorithm and the Gaussian Proccess Regressor function was used to estimate the optimal model (including hyperparameter tuning). On the public dataset in the evaluation server, the proposed model achieved a R-squared metric score of approximately 0.9709.
